## About Me

I recently completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in).
Currently, I am working on data science and software development projects at
[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com) as a graduate analyst. I have previously
[worked](https://github.com/iamshnoo/mlpack-testing)
with [mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack) as a
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student. I have also worked with the
[Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality Research Lab](https://cgvr.cs.uni-bremen.de/)
on research regarding continuous collision detection. I even have a couple of
papers with researchers from MIT and University of Toronto regarding
applications of deep learning methods to clinical procedures that help in early detection of cancer.

I am applying for grad school for Fall 2022 and would like to work on any of my
broad interests outlined below. I am open to working on other topics as long as
it is interesting :)

## Research Interests

These are just topics that I have previously explored to some extent. Obviously
I haven't explored everything yet, and I might just be interested in something
that is not yet in this list.

- **Computer Vision:** image to image translation, video understanding
- **Natural Language Processing:** unsupervised classification
- **Broad topics:** healthcare, explainability, fairness
