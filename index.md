<!-- ## About Me -->

I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from
[IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in) in 2021. Then I spent the next year or
so working in a data science/ software development role at
[Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com). I have previously
[worked](https://github.com/iamshnoo/mlpack-testing)
with the [PAIR team at Google](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit) and
[mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack) as part of the
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program. I have also [worked](Continuous_Collision_Detection_in_CollDet.pdf) with the
[Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality Research Lab](https://cgvr.cs.uni-bremen.de/)
on research regarding continuous collision detection. I even have a couple of
papers with researchers from MIT and University of Toronto regarding
applications of deep learning methods to clinical procedures that help in
reducing chances of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer. For an updated list on
my publications, please refer to my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3849YpIAAAAJ).

I have started my PhD in Fall 2022 with the NLP group at GMU
and my research interests lie in the following topics!

## Research Interests

Disclaimer: I am new to research in NLP and might just be
interested in something that is not yet in this list.

- Fairness, Interpretability and Explainability for language models
- Low resource NLP
- Multilingual NLP applications
- Adversarial attacks against language models and their defenses
- AI for healthcare
